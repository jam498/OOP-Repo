This is a simple implementation of the game of war.
A class named "Cardd" is created, and it's elements are enumerated values of rank and suit.
A function named build decks creates an abstraction of a 52 playing card deck, and then divides it randomly into 2 26 card decks.
The 2 decks are abstractions for the players role in the game. Using this, the function named war is called.
war compares the ranks of the top card on each stack, incremements a counter for the player with the higher rank, and then compares
the counters to determine a winner.
